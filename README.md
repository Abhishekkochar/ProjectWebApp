# ProjectWebApp
This repository is the web app for the final project. This app is an e-commerce web app made using node.js and ejs template. 

All the products are reusable items such as Metal bottles, wooden/metal straw and reusable bags. We used javaScript for both front and back end.
For database we are using clounf mongo db. Everything will be stored in cloub. We used passport.js for login.
